## Contents

This repository contains all data and code required to reproduce the analyses in the article published in *Science of the Total Environment*, excluding some initial data-cleaning steps.

It includes a modified version of the USEEIO model, version 1.1. Active development of USEEIO has moved to the [useeior](https://github.com/USEPA/useeior/) package. The included version of USEEIO was modified from [this release](https://github.com/USEPA/USEEIO/releases/tag/v0.2-alpha).

## Instructions

To reproduce the analysis, clone the repository locally and run `analysis.R` to reproduce the analyses that appear in Figures 2, 3, and 4. You should obtain the same output as is already included in the `output` directory of this repo.

To reproduce Figures 2, 3, and 4, use the output files found in the `output` directory or those generated by `analysis.R` to run `figures.R`.
