This repository contains all data and code required to reproduce the analyses in the article published in *Science of the Total Environment*, excluding some initial data-cleaning steps.

It includes a modified version of the USEEIO model, version 1.1. Active development of USEEIO has moved to the [useeior](https://github.com/USEPA/useeior/) package. The 

To reproduce the analysis, clone the repository locally and run `analysis.R` to reproduce the analyses that appear in Figures 2, 3, and 4.

To reproduce Figures 2, 3, and 4, use the output files generated by `analysis.R` to run `figures.R`.
